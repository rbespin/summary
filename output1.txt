It's
that
time
again.
Do
or
die.
In
or
out.
Dust
off
the
old
cliche
about
how,
from
here
on
out,
it's
a
direct
elimination
tournament
and
every
game
is
a
final.
Because
for
Argentina
it's
now
a
reality.
If
Lionel
Messi
and
Co.
fail
to
beat
Qatar
on
Sunday
night,
their
Copa
America
is
over
with
a
whimper.
The
trophyless
drought
will
extend
to
26
years,
all
the
way
back
to
1993,
when
Gabriel
Batistuta,
Fernando
Redondo
and
Diego
Simeone
led
the
Albiceleste
to
the
Copa
America
in
Ecuador.
It's
by
some
margin
the
longest
streak
among
footballing
superpowers
when
it
comes
to
continental
titles
and
World
Cups.
And
if
you're
one
of
those
pedants
who
wants
to
point
out
the
two
Olympic
Gold
medals
--
don't.
They
don't
count.
It's
not
that
they
haven't
come
close.
They
were
Copa
America
runners-up
on
four
occasions,
and
on
three
of
them,
including
the
last
two,
they
lost
out
on
penalty
kicks.
Then
five
years
ago,
at
the
World
Cup,
they
were
beaten
by
Germany
in
extra-time
in
the
final.
And
yet
there
are
Argentines
in
their
mid-twenties
who
have
never
seen
their
country
lift
a
major
trophy,
despite
the
fact
that,
since
achieving
puberty,
they've
had
Messi
lining
up
for
them.
Yes,
the
elephant
in
the
room:
Messi.
By
the
time
he
turns
32
on
Monday,
he
could
be
on
his
way
home
from
the
2019
Copa
America.
Some
birthday,
eh?
As
ever,
the
haters
will
use
it
to
undermine
his
GOAT
credentials,
and,
at
least
outside
of
Argentina,
it
will
provide
a
distraction
from
a
second
consecutive
summer
of
failure,
after
the
debacle
of
Russia
2018.
The
uncomfortable
part
is
that
this
Copa
America
in
some
ways
is
following
a
similar
script
to
the
World
Cup
a
year
ago.
Argentina
went
into
that
tournament
having
appointed
Jorge
Sampaoli,
a
"system
coach"
who
had
won
the
Copa
America
with
Chile
and
was
supposed
to
limit
the
"Messi-dependency"
with
carefully
crafted
movement,
pressing
and
team
play.
Even
his
biggest
proponents
--
including
yours
truly
--
would
have
to
admit
that
he
might
have
been
the
right
man
but
at
the
wrong
time
when
he
was
named
but,
once
in
Russia,
turned
into
the
wrong
man
at
the
worst
possible
time.
Argentina
were
chaotic
and
disorganized
and
whatever
message
he
had
never
seemed
to
get
through.
By
the
time
they
crashed
out,
there
were
murmurs
that
he
was
merely
a
bystander,
with
the
senior
players
deciding
lineup
and
tactics.
His
successor,
Lionel
Scaloni,
was
appointed
with
zero
managerial
experience
and
just
two
years'
worth
of
assistant
coaching
(both
of
them,
ironically,
with
Sampaoli).
The
fact
that
he
technically
still
on
an
interim
contract
--
set
to
expire
after
the
Copa
America
--
says
even
more
about
the
dysfunctionality
and
difficulties
of
the
Argentine
FA.
Scaloni
has
built
a
side
for
the
Copa
with
an
eye
towards
Qatar
2022.
He
shifted
away
from
familiar
veterans,
called
up
loads
of
newcomers
--
both
youngsters
like
Juan
Foyth
and
guys
like
Matias
Suarez,
Milton
Casco,
Guido
Pizarro
and
Rodrigo
De
Paul,
long
overlooked
by
Argentina
--
and
tried
to
stabilise
the
back
line
while
adding
some
creativity
to
the
midfield.
But
at
the
first
hurdle
--
Colombia
--
Argentina
looked
like
the
side
of
old.
The
opposition
got
physical
--
as
you'd
expect
in
a
Copa
America
game
--
and
the
Albiceleste
lost
the
plot,
going
down
2-0.
Perhaps
the
more
troubling
part
was
Scaloni's
reaction.
He
made
four
changes,
including
dropping
veterans
Angel
Di
Maria
and
Sergio
Aguero,
and
switched
from
4-3-3
to
4-4-1-1,
with
Lautaro
Martinez,
making
his
first
international
start
in
a
competitive
game,
leading
the
line
and
Messi
floating
behind
him.
Paraguay
have
some
quality
individuals
and
are
not
the
uber-defensive
stereotype
of
yesteryear
under
Eduardo
Berizzo,
but
when
it
comes
to
a
South
American
war
of
attrition,
they
can
more
than
hold
their
own.
Argentina
struggled
to
create
anything
for
nearly
an
hour,
went
a
goal
down
on
a
counter-attack
in
which
no
midfield
runner
was
tracked
and,
after
Messi
equalised
from
the
spot,
needed
a
Franco
Amani
penalty
save
to
escape
with
a
point.
The
most
worrying
bit
is
that,
apart
from
a
spell
in
the
second
half
of
the
Paraguay
game
when
Sergio
Aguero,
on
at
half-time,
combined
well
with
Martinez
and
Messi,
they've
shown
very
little
in
their
first
180
minutes
of
the
tournament.
And
Scaloni's
decisions
--
from
the
changes
in
personnel
and
formations
to
the
Di
Maria
for
Martinez
substitution
in
the
second
game,
which
ended
up
blunting
their
attack
--
have
almost
all
backfired
badly.
Qatar
is
the
quintessential
trap
game.
It's
easy
to
mock,
but
there's
a
reason
they're
the
defending
Asian
champions.
They
stormed
back
from
two
goals
down
to
grab
a
point
against
Paraguay
and
only
succumbed
to
a
late,
late
goal
against
Colombia
in
their
second
group
contest.
In
both
matches
they
have
played
better
than
the
scoreline
suggests.
Scaloni
knows
these
could
be
his
last
90
minutes
as
Argentina
boss.
Given
his
reaction
to
the
initial
defeat,
it's
not
unreasonable
to
expect
another
180
degree
change
in
approach
for
Qatar
in
the
hope
of
finding
whatever
magic
formula
it
takes
to
get
Argentina
to
play
like
Argentina.
Otherwise,
the
drought
will
be
extended.
And
the
fact
that
their
past
two
tournaments
will
have
ended
not
in
heartbreak
like
the
previous
ones
but
in
humiliation
won't
make
the
pain
any
less
severe.
